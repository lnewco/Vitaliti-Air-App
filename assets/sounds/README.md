## gentle-chime.mp3

This sound file should be a gentle, non-intrusive chime sound that plays when the intra-session feedback overlay appears.

Recommended specifications:
- Duration: 0.5 - 1.0 seconds
- Volume: Low to medium (normalized to -12dB)
- Tone: Soft, pleasant notification sound
- Format: MP3, 128kbps minimum

If the sound file is missing, the app will fall back to haptic feedback on supported devices.
