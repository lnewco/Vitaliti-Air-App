- **Fix:** Removed duplicate `SupabaseService.createSession()` call
- **Impact:** Eliminated duplicate sessions in database

### 2. Fixed RLS Policy Violations
**File:** `supabase/migrations/fix_rls_policies.sql`
- **Issue:** Anonymous users couldn't create sessions due to RLS policies
- **Fix:** Added policies allowing anonymous session creation with proper user_id handling
- **Tables affected:** `sessions`, `session_adaptive_events`, `session_readings`, `session_surveys`

### 3. Fixed Session Creation Reference Error
**File:** `src/services/SupabaseService.js`
- **Issue:** Used undefined `currentUser` variable instead of `userId`
- **Fix:** Corrected variable reference in session creation
- **Line:** 712

### 4. Fixed Pre-Session Survey Schema
**File:** `src/services/SupabaseService.js`
- **Issue:** Tried to insert non-existent columns (device_id, survey_type)
- **Fix:** Removed invalid columns from survey insert
- **Impact:** Pre-session surveys now sync successfully

### 5. Fixed Performance Degradation from Error Loops
**File:** `src/services/SupabaseService.js`
- **Issue:** Thousands of retry attempts causing app freeze
- **Fix:** Added aggressive sync queue cleanup and error limits
- **Methods affected:** `processSyncQueue()`, `syncReading()`, `syncAdaptiveEvent()`

### 6. Fixed Circular Dependency Crash
**File:** `src/utils/altitude-conversion.js` (created)
- **Issue:** ALTITUDE_CONVERSION in ActiveSession.js caused "useInsertionEffect" error
- **Fix:** Extracted altitude conversion to separate utility file
- **Impact:** Eliminated app crashes during sessions

### 7. Fixed Altitude Animation Timing
**File:** `src/screens/ActiveSession.js`
- **Issue:** Animation triggered immediately on OK press instead of after countdown
- **Fix:** Prevented premature `setIsTransitioning(true)` call

## 🎯 IHHT Dial Adjustment & Protocol Configuration Updates

### Date: 2025-01-09 (Session 2)

### 1. Fixed Critical Dial Adjustment Logic
**File:** `src/services/AdaptiveInstructionEngine.js`
- **Issue:** Dial adjustment was using MINIMUM SpO2 >= 90% to trigger increase (too strict)
- **Fix:** Changed to use AVERAGE SpO2 > 90% to trigger increase
- **Correct Rules Now:**
  - Increase altitude if: Average SpO2 > 90%
  - Decrease altitude if: Average SpO2 < 85% OR 2+ mask lifts in phase
- **Removed:** Dead code methods `endAltitudePhase()` and `calculateAltitudeAdjustment()` that were never called

### 2. Fixed Metrics Not Saving to Database
**File:** `src/services/IHHTMetricsTracker.js`
- **Issue:** Metrics were calculated but never persisted to database
- **Fix:** Added proper database save calls in `endPhase()` method
- **Now Saves:**
  - Phase statistics to `session_phase_stats` table
  - Cycle metrics to `session_cycle_metrics` table
  - Adaptation indices to `session_adaptation_metrics` table

### 3. Fixed Timer Duration Calculation Bug
**File:** `src/screens/SimplifiedSessionSetup.js`
- **Issue:** Durations were multiplied by 60 twice (once in setup, once in session)
- **Result:** 7 minutes showed as 420 minutes (7 × 60 × 60)
- **Fix:** Removed multiplication in SimplifiedSessionSetup, kept only in IHHTSessionSimple
- **Impact:** Timer now correctly shows 45 minutes for 5 cycles × (7+3) minutes

### 4. Added Dynamic Protocol Configuration
**File:** `src/screens/SimplifiedSessionSetup.js`
- **New Features:**
  - Tap-to-adjust controls for protocol parameters
  - Total cycles: 1-5 (default: 5, AI recommended)
  - Hypoxic duration: 3-10 minutes (default: 7, AI recommended)
  - Recovery duration: 2-5 minutes (default: 3, AI recommended)
- **UI Improvements:**
  - Up/down chevron arrows show tap direction
  - Green arrows point toward AI-recommended values
  - "AI" badge appears on recommended settings
  - Green highlighting for values matching AI recommendation
  - Clear visual feedback for interactive controls

### 5. Enhanced UI/UX for Protocol Settings
**Visual Indicators:**
- ✅ Green "AI" badge when using recommended values
- ✅ Green chevron arrows pointing to AI recommendations
- ✅ Highlighted borders for AI-recommended settings
- ✅ "AI-Optimized IHHT" subtitle
- ✅ TAP badges with directional hints

### 6. Progressive Overload Confirmation
**File:** `src/components/altitude-agent/AltitudeAgentWidget.tsx` (Analytics)
- **Verified:** Progressive overload calculations working correctly
- **Stored in:** `altitude_progressions` table in Supabase
- **Includes:**
  - Deconditioning adjustments based on days since last session
  - Recovery score integration from wearables
  - Performance trend analysis
  - Automatic baseline reduction (-1 level from last session end)

## 🔧 Critical avgSpO2 Calculation Fix for Dial Adjustments

### Date: 2025-01-09 (Session 3)

### Fixed Missing avgSpO2 Causing No Dial Adjustments
**Files:** `src/services/AdaptiveInstructionEngine.js`, `src/services/EnhancedSessionManager.js`

**Issue:** 
- Dial adjustments were never triggered despite high SpO2 readings (e.g., 93.7% average)
- Root cause: `avgSpO2` was null when `calculateNextAltitudeLevel()` was called
- SpO2 readings were only being tracked for RECOVERY phases, not ALTITUDE phases
- Dead code removal had eliminated the avgSpO2 calculation logic

**Fix Implementation:**
1. **Added SpO2 tracking for altitude phases** (`AdaptiveInstructionEngine.js`):
   - Initialize `avgSpO2: null` in `startAltitudePhase()`
   - Created `calculateCurrentPhaseAvgSpO2()` method to compute average from readings
   - Method calculates average from `currentPhaseSpO2Readings` array
   - Updates `currentPhaseStats.avgSpO2` with calculated value

2. **Pre-calculate avgSpO2 before phase transitions** (`EnhancedSessionManager.js`):
   - Calculate avgSpO2 10 seconds before altitude phase ends
   - Added `hasCalculatedPhaseAvgSpO2` flag to prevent duplicate calculations
   - Ensures avgSpO2 is available before `calculateNextAltitudeLevel()` runs
   - Also calculates at transition time if not already done

3. **Timing of dial instructions**:
   - Dial adjustment instructions now appear right after mask switching instructions
   - Proper notification queue ordering maintained

**Verification:**
- ✅ avgSpO2 now correctly calculated during altitude phases
- ✅ Dial adjustments triggered when avgSpO2 > 90% (increase) or < 85% (decrease)
- ✅ Dial events properly recorded in `session_adaptive_events` table
- ✅ Instructions appear at correct time in notification queue

**Impact:**
- Users will now receive proper dial adjustment instructions based on their SpO2 levels
- Progressive overload system can properly adapt altitude levels during sessions
- Session data accurately reflects altitude changes made during training

## 🔧 Comprehensive Session Data Fixes

### Date: 2025-01-09 (Session 4)

### Fixed Multiple Critical Session Issues

#### 1. Duration Showing as 0:00
**Files:** `src/services/EnhancedSessionManager.js`

**Problem:**
- Session duration displayed as "0:00" in session history
- `total_duration_seconds` field was 0 or NULL in database
- Stats calculation was returning hardcoded values (avgSpO2: 95, avgHeartRate: 72)

**Root Causes:**
- `calculateSessionStats()` was returning fixed values instead of actual data
- Only partial stats (avgSpO2, avgHeartRate) were passed to `SupabaseService.endSession()`
- Missing tracking for actual time spent in altitude/recovery phases

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Before: Hardcoded values
return { avgSpO2: 95, avgHeartRate: 72 };

// After: Actual calculation from readings
const avgSpO2 = validSpO2Readings.length > 0 
  ? Math.round(validSpO2Readings.reduce((sum, r) => sum + r.spo2, 0) / validSpO2Readings.length)
  : null;
```

**Complete Stats Now Tracked:**
- avgSpO2, minSpO2, maxSpO2 (calculated from actual readings)
- avgHeartRate, minHeartRate, maxHeartRate
- totalReadings count
- actualHypoxicTime and actualHyperoxicTime (tracked per second)
- actualCyclesCompleted and completionPercentage
- currentAltitudeLevel and totalAltitudeAdjustments
- totalMaskLifts from adaptive engine

#### 2. Multiple Duplicate Sessions
**Files:** `src/services/EnhancedSessionManager.js`

**Problem:**
- Multiple sessions created at exactly same timestamp (e.g., 5+ sessions at 12:43 PM)
- Sessions showing with identical stats (95% SpO2, 72 HR)
- App screenshot showed repeated duplicate entries

**Root Causes:**
- No check for existing active session before creating new one
- Multiple session start calls without proper cleanup
- Abandoned sessions from app crashes not handled

**Fix Implementation:**
```javascript
// Check for existing active session first
const existingActive = await AsyncStorage.getItem('activeSession');
if (existingActive) {
  const activeData = JSON.parse(existingActive);
  const sessionAge = Date.now() - activeData.startTime;
  if (sessionAge > 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000) {
    // Clear old session (>2 hours)
    await AsyncStorage.removeItem('activeSession');
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Active session already exists: ${activeData.id}`);
  }
}
```

**Duplicate Prevention Measures:**
- Session start lock mechanism (`sessionStartInProgress` flag)
- Active session check in AsyncStorage
- Automatic cleanup of abandoned sessions >2 hours old
- Single promise for concurrent start attempts

#### 3. Missing Phase Time Tracking
**Files:** `src/services/EnhancedSessionManager.js`

**Problem:**
- `actualHypoxicTime` and `actualHyperoxicTime` always 0
- No tracking of time spent in each phase type
- Completion percentage couldn't be calculated

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Track total time in each phase type (in timer interval)
if (this.currentPhase === 'ALTITUDE') {
  this.totalAltitudeTime = (this.totalAltitudeTime || 0) + 1;
} else if (this.currentPhase === 'RECOVERY') {
  this.totalRecoveryTime = (this.totalRecoveryTime || 0) + 1;
}
```

**Now Tracking:**
- Increments totalAltitudeTime every second during altitude phases
- Increments totalRecoveryTime every second during recovery phases
- Properly resets counters in `resetSessionState()`
- Includes actual times in session stats for database storage

#### 4. Altitude Adjustments Not Counted
**Files:** `src/services/EnhancedSessionManager.js`

**Problem:**
- `total_altitude_adjustments` always 0 in database
- No tracking when altitude level changed during session
- Progressive overload analysis missing adjustment data

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Track altitude adjustments in setAltitudeLevel()
if (previousLevel !== level) {
  this.totalAltitudeAdjustments = (this.totalAltitudeAdjustments || 0) + 1;
  console.log(`📊 Altitude adjustment #${this.totalAltitudeAdjustments}: ${previousLevel} → ${level}`);
}
```

**Tracking Added To:**
- `setAltitudeLevel()` method
- `applyPendingAltitudeAdjustment()` method
- Included in final session stats
- Reset in `resetSessionState()`

#### 5. User ID Mismatch
**Investigation Results:**
- Sessions being created with user_id: `da754dc4-e0bb-45f3-8547-71c2a6f2786c`
- This is the correct authenticated user from Supabase
- Last sign-in: 2025-09-08 15:56:22
- User ID comes from `supabase.auth.getUser()` which is working correctly

### Database Query Results

**Your Recent Session Statistics:**
```sql
Session ID: 6fde62be-a8c7-40f0-a9e9-6b172a70e21d
Duration: 15 minutes (12:17 PM - 12:32 PM)
Total Readings: 1787
Average SpO2: 94.8% (should have triggered dial increase)
Min SpO2: 89%
Max SpO2: 99%
Average HR: 73 bpm
```

### Verification Checklist
- ✅ Duration now calculated from (end_time - start_time)
- ✅ Complete stats object passed to SupabaseService
- ✅ Actual metrics calculated from session readings
- ✅ Duplicate session prevention implemented
- ✅ Active session tracking in AsyncStorage
- ✅ Phase time tracking (altitude/recovery)
