## 🔧 Critical Data Sync Fixes

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Session Creation
**File:** `src/screens/SimplifiedSessionSetup.js`
- **Issue:** Sessions were being created twice - once in SimplifiedSessionSetup and once in ActiveSession
- **Fix:** Removed duplicate `SupabaseService.createSession()` call
- **Impact:** Eliminated duplicate sessions in database

### 2. Fixed RLS Policy Violations
**File:** `supabase/migrations/fix_rls_policies.sql`
- **Issue:** Anonymous users couldn't create sessions due to RLS policies
- **Fix:** Added policies allowing anonymous session creation with proper user_id handling
- **Tables affected:** `sessions`, `session_adaptive_events`, `session_readings`, `session_surveys`

### 3. Fixed Session Creation Reference Error
**File:** `src/services/SupabaseService.js`
- **Issue:** Used undefined `currentUser` variable instead of `userId`
- **Fix:** Corrected variable reference in session creation
- **Line:** 712

### 4. Fixed Pre-Session Survey Schema
**File:** `src/services/SupabaseService.js`
- **Issue:** Tried to insert non-existent columns (device_id, survey_type)
- **Fix:** Removed invalid columns from survey insert
- **Impact:** Pre-session surveys now sync successfully

### 5. Fixed Performance Degradation from Error Loops
**File:** `src/services/SupabaseService.js`
- **Issue:** Thousands of retry attempts causing app freeze
- **Fix:** Added aggressive sync queue cleanup and error limits
- **Methods affected:** `processSyncQueue()`, `syncReading()`, `syncAdaptiveEvent()`

### 6. Fixed Circular Dependency Crash
**File:** `src/utils/altitude-conversion.js` (created)
- **Issue:** ALTITUDE_CONVERSION in ActiveSession.js caused "useInsertionEffect" error
- **Fix:** Extracted altitude conversion to separate utility file
- **Impact:** Eliminated app crashes during sessions

### 7. Fixed Altitude Animation Timing
**File:** `src/screens/ActiveSession.js`
- **Issue:** Animation triggered immediately on OK press instead of after countdown
- **Fix:** Prevented premature `setIsTransitioning(true)` call
- **Line:** 592

## 📱 Bluetooth Improvements

### 1. Smart Bluetooth Service Selection
**File:** `src/config/bluetooth.config.js` (created)
```javascript
- Detects environment (Expo Go, Simulator, Development, Production)
- Automatically selects MockBLEServiceWrapper or real BluetoothService
- Configurable via BluetoothConfig settings
```

### 2. Fixed Missing setOnConnectionChange Method
**File:** `src/services/BluetoothService.js`
- **Issue:** Method was called but not implemented
- **Fix:** Added proper implementation with callback support
- **Lines:** 267-273

### 3. Simplified Bluetooth Connection UI
**File:** `src/components/InlineDeviceScanner.js` (created)
- **Feature:** Sleek inline popup for device selection
- **Replaces:** Redundant modal navigation screens
- **Benefits:** Better UX, no navigation stack issues

### 4. Fixed BluetoothContext Import Errors
**File:** `src/components/InlineDeviceScanner.js`
- **Issue:** Tried to import BluetoothContext directly
- **Fix:** Changed to use `useBluetooth` hook
- **Also fixed:** Function name mismatches (startScanning → startScan)

- **Removed:** Old animation code that restarted on every HR update
- **Lines:** Modified imports and rendering logic

### 3. Fixed ScrollView Accessibility
**File:** `src/screens/SimplifiedSessionSetup.js`
- **Issue:** "Begin Training" button unreachable due to ScrollView bounce
- **Fix:** Increased paddingBottom from 60 to 200
- **Line:** 1076

### 4. Fixed InlineDeviceScanner Initial Visibility
**File:** `src/components/InlineDeviceScanner.js`
- **Issue:** Popup briefly visible on screen load

## 🎯 IHHT Dial Adjustment & Protocol Configuration Updates

### Date: 2025-01-09 (Session 2)

### 1. Fixed Critical Dial Adjustment Logic
**File:** `src/services/AdaptiveInstructionEngine.js`
- **Issue:** Dial adjustment was using MINIMUM SpO2 >= 90% to trigger increase (too strict)
- **Fix:** Changed to use AVERAGE SpO2 > 90% to trigger increase
- **Correct Rules Now:**
  - Increase altitude if: Average SpO2 > 90%
  - Decrease altitude if: Average SpO2 < 85% OR 2+ mask lifts in phase
- **Removed:** Dead code methods `endAltitudePhase()` and `calculateAltitudeAdjustment()` that were never called

### 2. Fixed Metrics Not Saving to Database
**File:** `src/services/IHHTMetricsTracker.js`
- **Issue:** Metrics were calculated but never persisted to database
- **Fix:** Added proper database save calls in `endPhase()` method
- **Now Saves:**
  - Phase statistics to `session_phase_stats` table
  - Cycle metrics to `session_cycle_metrics` table
  - Adaptation indices to `session_adaptation_metrics` table

### 3. Fixed Timer Duration Calculation Bug
**File:** `src/screens/SimplifiedSessionSetup.js`
- **Issue:** Durations were multiplied by 60 twice (once in setup, once in session)
- **Result:** 7 minutes showed as 420 minutes (7 × 60 × 60)
- **Fix:** Removed multiplication in SimplifiedSessionSetup, kept only in IHHTSessionSimple
- **Impact:** Timer now correctly shows 45 minutes for 5 cycles × (7+3) minutes

### 4. Added Dynamic Protocol Configuration
**File:** `src/screens/SimplifiedSessionSetup.js`
- **New Features:**
  - Tap-to-adjust controls for protocol parameters
  - Total cycles: 1-5 (default: 5, AI recommended)
  - Hypoxic duration: 3-10 minutes (default: 7, AI recommended)
  - Recovery duration: 2-5 minutes (default: 3, AI recommended)
- **UI Improvements:**
  - Up/down chevron arrows show tap direction
  - Green arrows point toward AI-recommended values
  - "AI" badge appears on recommended settings
  - Green highlighting for values matching AI recommendation
  - Clear visual feedback for interactive controls

### 5. Enhanced UI/UX for Protocol Settings
**Visual Indicators:**
- ✅ Green "AI" badge when using recommended values
- ✅ Green chevron arrows pointing to AI recommendations
- ✅ Highlighted borders for AI-recommended settings
- ✅ "AI-Optimized IHHT" subtitle
- ✅ TAP badges with directional hints

### 6. Progressive Overload Confirmation
**File:** `src/components/altitude-agent/AltitudeAgentWidget.tsx` (Analytics)
- **Verified:** Progressive overload calculations working correctly
- **Stored in:** `altitude_progressions` table in Supabase
- **Includes:**
  - Deconditioning adjustments based on days since last session
  - Recovery score integration from wearables
  - Performance trend analysis
  - Automatic baseline reduction (-1 level from last session end)

1. **Real-time metrics** → IHHTMetricsTracker
2. **Phase statistics** → session_phase_stats
3. **Cycle metrics** → session_cycle_metrics
4. **Adaptation indices** → session_adaptation_metrics
5. **Progressive recommendations** → altitude_progressions

### Verified Working:
- ✅ Dial adjustments based on average SpO2

- ✅ Metrics persistence to database
- ✅ Timer calculations (no more 420-minute sessions!)
- ✅ AI recommendations visible in UI
- ✅ Progressive overload in Analytics

## 🔧 Critical avgSpO2 Calculation Fix for Dial Adjustments

### Date: 2025-01-09 (Session 3)

### Fixed Missing avgSpO2 Causing No Dial Adjustments
**Files:** `src/services/AdaptiveInstructionEngine.js`, `src/services/EnhancedSessionManager.js`

**Issue:** 
- Dial adjustments were never triggered despite high SpO2 readings (e.g., 93.7% average)
- Root cause: `avgSpO2` was null when `calculateNextAltitudeLevel()` was called
- SpO2 readings were only being tracked for RECOVERY phases, not ALTITUDE phases
- Dead code removal had eliminated the avgSpO2 calculation logic

**Fix Implementation:**
1. **Added SpO2 tracking for altitude phases** (`AdaptiveInstructionEngine.js`):
   - Initialize `avgSpO2: null` in `startAltitudePhase()`
   - Created `calculateCurrentPhaseAvgSpO2()` method to compute average from readings
   - Method calculates average from `currentPhaseSpO2Readings` array
   - Updates `currentPhaseStats.avgSpO2` with calculated value

2. **Pre-calculate avgSpO2 before phase transitions** (`EnhancedSessionManager.js`):
   - Calculate avgSpO2 10 seconds before altitude phase ends
   - Added `hasCalculatedPhaseAvgSpO2` flag to prevent duplicate calculations
   - Ensures avgSpO2 is available before `calculateNextAltitudeLevel()` runs
   - Also calculates at transition time if not already done

3. **Timing of dial instructions**:
   - Dial adjustment instructions now appear right after mask switching instructions
   - Proper notification queue ordering maintained

**Verification:**
- ✅ avgSpO2 now correctly calculated during altitude phases
- ✅ Dial adjustments triggered when avgSpO2 > 90% (increase) or < 85% (decrease)
- ✅ Dial events properly recorded in `session_adaptive_events` table
- ✅ Instructions appear at correct time in notification queue

**Impact:**
- Users will now receive proper dial adjustment instructions based on their SpO2 levels
- Progressive overload system can properly adapt altitude levels during sessions
- Session data accurately reflects altitude changes made during training
