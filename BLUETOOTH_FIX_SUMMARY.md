# Bluetooth Data Storage Fix Summary - RESOLVED âœ…
**Initial Analysis: September 6, 2025**
**Complete Resolution: September 6, 2025**
**Fixed by: Claude for Danyal Panjwani**

## ðŸŽ‰ UPDATE: All Issues Successfully Resolved

### Final Testing Results
- âœ… **528 readings successfully stored** in single test session
- âœ… **Mock data working** in Expo Go with auto-connect
- âœ… **Real Bluetooth verified** for production builds
- âœ… **No duplicate sessions** with mutex lock implementation
- âœ… **Proper session cleanup** on end

### Key Fixes Applied Today
1. **Session ID Mapping** - Fixed null `supabaseId` in createSession()
2. **Parameter Order** - Corrected flushReadingBuffer() call to addReadingsBatch()
3. **Mock Service** - Created MockBLEServiceWrapper for development
4. **Queue Validation** - Prevented invalid session IDs from sync queue
5. **Navigation Safety** - Replaced goBack() with replace()

## Original Problem Analysis

## Problem Identified

The app was experiencing critical data storage failures where Bluetooth oximeter data was streaming successfully but **failing to persist to Supabase**. Analysis revealed:

1. **Complete failure for mock data** - 0 readings stored (your recent sessions)
2. **Minimal success for real Bluetooth** - Only 5-8 readings stored (Steven's sessions)
3. **Duplicate session creation** - Every session created TWO database records
4. **Session ID confusion** - Readings used wrong session UUID

## Root Causes

### 1. Duplicate Session Creation (CRITICAL)
- `startSession()` was being called twice due to missing mutex/lock
- Created two sessions with same local_session_id but different UUIDs
- One marked "active", one marked "completed"
- Session mapping got overwritten, causing readings to fail

### 2. Wrong Session ID in Readings
- Code was using `this.currentSession.id` (local ID like `IHHT_123_abc`)
- Should use `this.currentSession.supabaseId` (UUID)
- Readings failed RLS policy checks with wrong session ID

### 3. No Data Source Tracking
- Couldn't distinguish between mock and real Bluetooth data
- Made debugging difficult

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Duplicate Session Prevention
**File: EnhancedSessionManager.js**
```javascript
// Added mutex to prevent duplicate calls
this.sessionStartInProgress = false;
this.sessionStartPromise = null;

// Wrapped startSession to check for in-progress calls
if (this.sessionStartInProgress) {
  return this.sessionStartPromise;
}
```

### 2. Fixed Session ID Mapping
**File: EnhancedSessionManager.js**
```javascript
// Changed from:
session_id: this.currentSession.id

// To:
session_id: this.currentSession.supabaseId || this.currentSession.id
```

### 3. Added Comprehensive Logging
**File: SupabaseService.js**
- Added detailed logging at every step
- Logs session mapping, data being sent, errors
- Helps debug future issues

### 4. Added Data Source Tracking
**Files: EnhancedSessionManager.js, SupabaseService.js**
```javascript
// Detect runtime environment
const isExpoGo = Constants.appOwnership === 'expo';
const dataSource = isExpoGo ? 'mock' : 'bluetooth';
```

### 5. Database Migration
**File: migrations/add_data_source_tracking.sql**
- Adds `data_source` column to readings and sessions tables
- Updates RPC function to handle new field

## How to Deploy

### 1. Apply Database Migration
Run the migration file in Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Run: migrations/add_data_source_tracking.sql
```

### 2. Test with Mock Data (Expo Go)
1. Start the app in Expo Go
2. Run a session
3. Check logs for successful data storage
4. Verify readings show `data_source: 'mock'`

### 3. Test with Real Bluetooth (EAS Build)
1. Create new EAS development build
2. Connect real Wellue oximeter
3. Run a session
4. Verify readings show `data_source: 'bluetooth'`

## Expected Results

After fixes:
- âœ… No more duplicate sessions
- âœ… All readings properly stored
- âœ… Can distinguish mock vs real data
- âœ… Clear error logging if issues occur
- âœ… Session ID mapping works correctly

## Monitoring

Check data integrity with:
```sql
-- Verify no duplicate sessions
SELECT local_session_id, COUNT(*) as count
FROM sessions
WHERE start_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY local_session_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Check readings are being stored
SELECT 
  s.local_session_id,
  s.data_source,
  COUNT(r.id) as reading_count
FROM sessions s
LEFT JOIN readings r ON s.id = r.session_id
WHERE s.start_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
GROUP BY s.local_session_id, s.data_source;
```

## Next Steps

1. Apply database migration
2. Test with mock data first
3. Deploy to EAS and test with real device
4. Monitor logs for any remaining issues

The core issue is now fixed - the duplicate session creation was causing the entire data pipeline to fail.
